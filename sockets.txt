what are sockets?

at their core, sockets are abstractions provided by OS to allow communication b/w processes
act as endpoints bw 2 way communicationchannels

socket= ip address + port number

OSI LAYER
TRANSPORT LAYER (LAYER 4)
SOCKET WRAPS INTO TCP/UDP SEGMENTS
SENDS TO LAYER 3 FOR ROUTING (NETWORK LAYER)

tcp/udp sockets are 2 main types

ON SERVERS SIDE
socket() : waits for incoming client connection and creates new socket, this one still listens for new conections
bind() : 
lsiten() :
accept() :

CLIENT PROCESS
3 way handshake SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK
Process table ( socket descriptor )

After communication,
close()

every socket identified by 5 tuple:
1 type (tcp/udp)
2 local port
3 local ip
4 dest port
5 dest ip

UNIX DOMAIN sockets
- comm bw process, do not require ip, no overhead, very fast
- postgres, redis

socket are inhenerlty insecure, TLS (TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY) is used
- wraps socket into encypted
- ssl
- man in the middle attacks
